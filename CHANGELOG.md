## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-28

### Added
- **Latin Language Support**: Added full support for Latin (language code `la`)
  - **Bidirectional translation**: Both English↔Latin directions fully supported
  - Automatic extraction of verb principal parts:
    - 1st person singular present (e.g., amō)
    - Present infinitive (e.g., amāre)
    - 1st person singular perfect (e.g., amāvī)
    - Supine (e.g., amātum)
  - Automatic extraction of noun forms:
    - Nominative form
    - Genitive form
    - Gender (m/f/n)
  - Automatic extraction of adjective forms:
    - Masculine form
    - Feminine form
    - Neuter form
  - Latin inflection data is automatically attached to English→Latin translations
  - Example: `translate('love', 'en', 'la')` now returns all 4 principal parts for "amo"
  - Example: `translate('amo', 'la', 'en')` returns "love"
- New utility module: `src/utils/latinHeadwordParser.ts` for extracting Latin grammatical forms
- Extended character class support in verb form detection to include Latin diacritics (macrons: āēīōū, breves: ăĕĭŏŭ)
- New test suite: `examples/test-latin.ts` demonstrating all Latin features

### Changed
- Updated language count from 14 to 15 languages
- Updated README with Latin examples and documentation
- Updated package.json keywords to include Latin-related terms (declension, conjugation, inflection)

### Fixed
- **Wiktionary HTML Structure Changes**: Enhanced parser to handle wrapped heading tags
  - Wiktionary now wraps h2 and h3/h4 tags in `<div class="mw-heading">` containers
  - Added flexible regex patterns that work with both wrapped and unwrapped headings
  - Ensures compatibility with current and future Wiktionary HTML structure changes
  - Affects all languages, not just Latin
- **Definition Link Detection**: Improved definition filter to allow short words before links
  - Previous filter required definitions to start immediately with a link
  - Now allows words like "to" before the link (e.g., "to love" in Latin definitions)
  - Maintains filtering of usage examples and quotations while supporting more definition formats

## [1.2.5] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed
- **Synonym Contamination**: Fixed issue where Wiktionary synonyms were being incorrectly included as translations
  - Problem: When translating words like Italian "ciao", synonyms (salve, buongiorno, arrivederla, etc.) were appearing as translations
  - Root cause: Wiktionary includes synonyms in `<dl>` (definition list) tags nested within definition `<li>` elements
  - Solution: Enhanced parser to remove `<dl>` tags (which contain synonyms, usage notes, and metadata) before extracting translations
  - Also added filter to skip `<li>` items that don't start with wiki links (filters out usage examples and quotations)
  - Examples now correct:
    - 🇮🇹 ciao → "hello, goodbye" (previously also included: salve, buongiorno, arrivederla, arrivederci, ci vediamo) ✓
    - 🇪🇸 hola → "hello" (no unwanted synonyms) ✓
    - 🇫🇷 bonjour → "greetings, hello, good day, good afternoon" (no unwanted synonyms) ✓

### Improved
- **Multiple Synonymous Translations**: Enhanced handling of definitions containing multiple synonymous translations
  - Problem: When a single definition contained multiple translations (e.g., "greetings; hello"), only the first word was searchable
  - Solution: Parser now creates separate translation entries for each linked word within a definition
  - Benefit: All translations are now individually searchable, not just the first one
  - Example: French "bonjour" as a noun now returns both "greetings" and "hello" as separate searchable entries
  - The `meaning` field still provides context by listing all synonymous translations together

### Changed
- Modified `parseEnglishWiktionaryForeignWord()` in `enWiktionaryParser.ts` to:
  - Remove `<dl>` tags before link extraction (line 320)
  - Skip `<li>` items that don't begin with wiki links (lines 322-326)
  - Create individual translation entries for each word in multi-word definitions (lines 344-353)

### Technical Details
- Enhanced HTML cleaning to properly exclude synonym sections marked with `<span class="nyms synonym">`
- Added validation to ensure only actual definitions (starting with wiki links) are processed
- Improved separation of definition content from metadata (synonyms, usage notes, quotations)

### Test Results
- ✅ Italian "ciao": Returns only "hello, goodbye" (no synonyms)
- ✅ French "bonjour": Now includes "hello" as a searchable translation
- ✅ Spanish, German, Portuguese: No regressions
- ✅ All other languages tested: Working correctly

### Examples
```typescript
// Before fix: Italian "ciao" incorrectly included synonyms
const ciao = await translator.translate('ciao', 'it', 'en');
// Was returning: hello, goodbye, salve, buongiorno, arrivederla, arrivederci, ci vediamo ❌

// After fix: Only actual definitions
console.log(ciao.translationsByType[0].translations);
// [{translation: "hello", meaning: "hello"}, {translation: "goodbye", meaning: "goodbye"}] ✓

// Before fix: French "bonjour" missing "hello"
const bonjour = await translator.translate('bonjour', 'fr', 'en');
// Was only returning: greetings (with "hello" buried in meaning field) ❌

// After fix: All translations searchable
console.log(bonjour.translationsByType[0].translations);
// [
//   {translation: "greetings", meaning: "greetings, hello"},
//   {translation: "hello", meaning: "greetings, hello"}
// ] ✓
```

## [1.2.4] - 2025-10-15

### Improved
- **Looser Parsing for Character Pages**: Enhanced parsing logic to be more forgiving and resilient when extracting translations from character-based language pages (Chinese, Japanese)
  - Improved regex patterns to handle more variations in HTML structure
  - Better handling of edge cases in definition lists and redirect templates
  - More robust extraction of English translations from various page formats
  - Reduces false negatives when page structure doesn't match expected patterns exactly

### Changed
- Relaxed strict matching requirements in Chinese "Definitions" section parser
- Updated English word extraction patterns to handle additional HTML variations
- Enhanced zh-see and ja-see template parsers for better compatibility

### Benefits
- More reliable translations for rare or less common characters
- Better handling of pages with non-standard formatting
- Improved success rate for character-based language translations
- More resilient to Wiktionary page structure changes

## [1.2.3] - 2025-10-14

### Fixed
- **Japanese Alternate Spelling Pages**: Fixed Japanese→English translations for alternate spelling pages (hiragana/katakana variants)
  - Japanese word "こんにちは" (konnichiwa/hello) was not returning translations despite the page existing on Wiktionary
  - Root cause: Pages for alternate spellings use a special `ja-see` template that redirects to the kanji version with a different HTML structure
  - Added special handling to detect and parse `<table class="wikitable ja-see">` templates
  - Extracts word types from `[type]` bracket patterns (e.g., `[interjection]`)
  - Extracts English translations from wiki links within the redirect table
  - Examples now working:
    - こんにちは (konnichiwa) → "good day, good afternoon" ✓
    - Other hiragana/katakana alternate spellings that redirect to kanji forms ✓
- **Chinese Character Translations**: Fixed Chinese→English translations for individual characters and phrases
  - Chinese character pages use a special "Definitions" h3 section instead of standard word type headings (Noun, Verb, etc.)
  - Added parser to extract English translations from definition lists under `<h3 id="Definitions">`
  - Two extraction patterns:
    - Pattern 1: English word links like `<a href="/wiki/dog">dog</a>`
    - Pattern 2: Plain English text before Chinese characters or parentheses
  - Examples now working:
    - 狗 (gǒu) → "dog" ✓
    - 爱 (ài) → "love, treasure, value" ✓
- **Chinese Simplified/Traditional Redirects**: Fixed `zh-see` template parsing for simplified Chinese redirects
  - Many simplified Chinese words (like 谢谢) redirect to traditional forms (like 謝謝) using a `zh-see` template, similar to Japanese's `ja-see`
  - Extended redirect format regex to match both `ja-see` and `zh-see` templates
  - Extracts all English word links from the redirect table, filtering out Chinese characters and meta links
  - Examples now working:
    - 谢谢 (xièxie) → "thanks, thank you, thank" ✓
    - 再见 (zàijiàn) → "goodbye, see you later, see" ✓

### Changed
- Enhanced `parseEnglishWiktionaryForeignWord()` to handle Chinese-specific page structures
- Updated redirect format detection to support both Japanese (`ja-see`) and Chinese (`zh-see`) templates
- Improved English word extraction with better filtering for Chinese characters and external links

### Technical Details
- Added special handling for `<h3 id="Definitions">Definitions</h3>` in Chinese sections
- Chinese character pages default to 'noun' word type (most common for single characters)
- Chinese phrase redirects default to 'interjection' word type (most common for expressions)
- Two-stage English extraction: first tries linked words, then falls back to plain text extraction

### Test Results
- ✅ Japanese alternate spelling pages: working (こんにちは and other hiragana/katakana variants)
- ✅ All 14 languages tested with "hello": all passing
- ✅ All 8 Chinese translation tests now passing (was 4/8, now 8/8)
- ✅ Chinese character translations: 4/4 passing
- ✅ English → Chinese translations: 4/4 passing
- ✅ Pinyin extraction: working for all tested words
- ✅ Pinyin search: working for common words (nihao, xiexie, zaijian)
- ✅ No regressions in other languages (Arabic, Korean, Spanish, French, etc.)

### Examples
```typescript
// Japanese alternate spellings now work
const hello = await translator.translate('こんにちは', 'ja', 'en');
console.log(hello.translationsByType[0].translations[0].translation); // "good day"
console.log(hello.headwordTransliteration); // "konnichiha"

// Chinese characters now work
const dog = await translator.translate('狗', 'zh', 'en');
console.log(dog.translationsByType[0].translations[0].translation); // "dog"
console.log(dog.headwordTransliteration); // "gǒu"

// Simplified Chinese redirects now work
const thanks = await translator.translate('谢谢', 'zh', 'en');
console.log(thanks.translationsByType[0].translations[0].translation); // "thanks"

const goodbye = await translator.translate('再见', 'zh', 'en');
console.log(goodbye.translationsByType[0].translations[0].translation); // "goodbye"

// Character with multiple meanings
const love = await translator.translate('爱', 'zh', 'en');
console.log(love.translationsByType[0].translations); // [{translation: "love", ...}, {translation: "treasure", ...}, ...]
```

### Known Limitations
- Pinyin search doesn't work for all words (e.g., "gou") due to Wiktionary's search algorithm prioritizing exact matches over romanized searches
- **Word type detection for Chinese characters**: Chinese character pages use a single "Definitions" h3 section without word type headings (no "Noun", "Verb", etc. as h3/h4/h5 elements). The parser defaults to "noun" since this is the most common category for single characters. The definitions themselves don't include word type indicators.
- Some rare characters or dialectal words may have incomplete definitions on English Wiktionary

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- **Korean Romanization**: Fixed extraction to use Revised Romanization from pronunciation tables instead of grammatical terms
  - Now correctly extracts "annyeonghaseyo" instead of "haeyoche" for 안녕하세요
  - Added specific pattern for Korean `<th>Revised Romanization</th>` table structure
  - Excluded Korean from `lang="ko-Latn"` fallback to prevent extracting grammar terminology
- **Arabic Romanization**: Fixed bullet point pattern to handle linked bullets (`<a>•</a>`)
  - Now correctly extracts "marḥaban" for مرحبا
  - Increased header section limit from 10,000 to 30,000 characters to find romanization in pages with phrasebook boxes
- **Chinese Romanization**: Added pinyin extraction from Chinese pronunciation sections
  - New pattern extracts pinyin from `<span class="...pinyin..."><a>pinyin</a></span>` structure
  - Automatically removes spaces between syllables (e.g., "nǐ hǎo" → "nǐhǎo")
  - Works for traditional Chinese characters (e.g., 你好 → "nǐhǎo", 朋友 → "péngyou")
  - Note: Simplified characters that redirect to traditional forms won't have romanization
- **Japanese Romanization**: Added extraction from `<span class="mention-tr tr">` tags
  - Now extracts romanization for Japanese words (e.g., こんにちは → "konnichiha")
  - Uses strict Hepburn romanization as provided by English Wiktionary

### Changed
- Increased header section scanning from 10,000 to 30,000 characters to accommodate pages with large infoboxes and tables
- Enhanced bullet point pattern to match both plain bullets (•) and linked bullets (`<a>•</a>`)
- Improved regex patterns to handle nested HTML tags in pronunciation sections

### Technical Details
- Added Pattern 2a: Korean Revised Romanization table extraction
- Added Pattern 2b: Chinese pinyin extraction with space normalization
- Added Pattern 3: `mention-tr` tag extraction for Japanese
- Updated Pattern 1: Bullet point pattern now handles linked bullets
- Updated Pattern 5: Removed Korean from lang-Latn fallback

### Examples
```typescript
// Korean - now extracts correct Revised Romanization
const ko = await translator.translate('안녕하세요', 'ko', 'en');
console.log(ko.headwordTransliteration); // "annyeonghaseyo" (was "haeyoche")

// Arabic - now finds romanization in pages with long headers
const ar = await translator.translate('مرحبا', 'ar', 'en');
console.log(ar.headwordTransliteration); // "marḥaban"

// Chinese - extracts pinyin for traditional characters
const zh = await translator.translate('你好', 'zh', 'en');
console.log(zh.headwordTransliteration); // "nǐhǎo"

// Japanese - extracts romaji from mention tags
const ja = await translator.translate('こんにちは', 'ja', 'en');
console.log(ja.headwordTransliteration); // "konnichiha"
```

### Changed
- Increased supported languages from 10 to 13
- Updated documentation with transliteration examples
- Enhanced `parseWiktionaryTranslationsByType()` to include phrase word type

### Test Coverage
- Added comprehensive test suite (`examples/test-arabic-korean.ts`)

// Arabic with transliteration
const result = await translator.translate('مرحبا', 'ar', 'en');
// Returns: { translations: [{ translation: 'hello', ... }], pronunciation: '/mar.ħa.ban/' }

// Korean phrase support
const result = await translator.translate('안녕하세요', 'ko', 'en');
// Returns: { wordType: 'phrase', translations: [{ translation: 'How are you?', ... }] }

// English to Arabic with transliteration
const result = await translator.translate('hello', 'en', 'ar');
// Returns: { translation: 'مَرْحَبًا', transliteration: 'marḥaban', ... }

// Reverse search: Find word from romanization
const suggestions = await translator.searchByTransliteration('annyeonghaseyo', 'ko');
// Returns: ['안녕하세요', '안녕', ...]
const translation = await translator.translate(suggestions[0], 'ko', 'en');
// Get the English translation
```

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-07

### Added
- **Automatic Accent Correction**: Wikiglot now automatically corrects missing accents and handles common misspellings
  - Two-stage fallback strategy:
    1. When a word page doesn't exist → searches for accent-corrected version
    2. When a page exists but has no content in the target language → searches for correct version
  - Examples:
    - `azucar` → finds `azúcar` (page doesn't exist)
    - `revolucion` → finds `revolución` (page exists for Esperanto, not Spanish)
    - `cafe` → finds `café` (page exists for English, not Portuguese)
    - `ecole` → finds `école` (page doesn't exist)
  - Returns correction metadata (`searchedFor`, `foundAs`) so apps can inform users
  - Zero overhead for exact matches - only adds 1 API call when corrections are needed
  - Works automatically for all supported languages
  - Smart filtering prefers accented versions when input has no accents

### Changed
- `TranslationResult` interface now includes optional `searchedFor` and `foundAs` fields for correction metadata

### Performance
- No performance impact on successful lookups (exact matches)
- Only 1 additional API call when accent correction is triggered
- ~120 lines of code added
- Zero new dependencies

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release

### Added
- Translation between English and Spanish/French
- Automatic verb form detection and base verb translation
- Pronunciation (IPA) extraction
- Translations organized by word type (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)
- Built-in rate limiting
- TypeScript support
- Zero dependencies (except node-fetch)
